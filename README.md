# FurBot

A glorified e621/e926 browser with some fun stuff

## Installation [Linux]

Create a folder for FurBot to reside in and navigate to it

```bash
mkdir furbotDir
cd furbotDir
```

Add a file called token.txt and put your Discord Bot token there

```bash
nano token.txt
```

To start up the bot, just do the following

```bash
cd FurBot
./bot.py
```

Add the bot to a Discord server and type ``f-help`` in a chat the bot can see to get a command list.
