# FurBot

A glorified e621/e926 browser with some fun stuff

## Installation

Create a folder for FurBot to reside in and navigate to it

```bash
mkdir furbotDir
cd furbotDir
```

Add a file called token.txt and put your Discord Bot token there

```bash
nano token.txt
```

To start up the bot, just do the following

```bash
python3 FurBot/bot.py
```

Add a bot to a Discord server and type in ``f-help`` to get a command list.
